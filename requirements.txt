# This requirements.txt is generated based on the pyproject.toml targeting
# a PyTorch 2.6.x XPU stack with ipex-llm[xpu_2.6].
#
# IMPORTANT:
# It's highly recommended to install ipex-llm with its extras first in a clean environment,
# as it will pull its specific, compatible versions of torch, intel-extension-for-pytorch, etc.,
# from the specified Intel indexes.
#
# Example manual installation order for such an environment:
# 1. pip install --pre --upgrade 'torch>=2.6.0,<2.7.0' --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu (find exact XPU wheel for 2.6.x)
# 2. pip install intel-extension-for-pytorch==2.6.10+xpu --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/
# 3. pip install --pre --upgrade 'ipex-llm[xpu_2.6]>=2.3.0rc1' --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
# 4. pip install -r requirements.txt (for the remaining packages)
#
# The versions listed below for torch, ipex, transformers etc. are based on the
# pyproject.toml and observed dependencies. The ipex-llm install will be the ultimate
# source of truth for compatible versions of its direct dependencies.

tqdm>=4.66.5

# --- PyTorch Stack & IPEX-LLM (Targeting PT 2.6.x toolchain) ---
# These versions should align with what ipex-llm[xpu_2.6] requires/installs.
# Poetry would resolve these, but for a flat requirements.txt, you'd ensure
# the ipex-llm install step (see above) correctly installs these.
torch>=2.6.0,<2.7.0 # Exact XPU build string will be resolved by pip from the index
torchaudio>=2.6.0,<2.7.0 # Match torch XPU version
intel-extension-for-pytorch==2.6.10+xpu
# oneccl_bind_pt==2.6.0+xpu # Uncomment if explicitly needed

ipex-llm[xpu_2.6]>=2.3.0rc1 # This is the key package to install correctly

# --- Dependencies likely pulled by ipex-llm[xpu_2.6] ---
# (Based on previous observations for ipex-llm 2.3.0rc1)
transformers==4.37.0
tokenizers==0.15.2

# Note: Other transitive dependencies of the above packages (like huggingface-hub, safetensors, etc.)
# will also be installed by pip. This file lists the primary ones defined in pyproject.toml
