 with over two decades working in the environmental consulting and local government fields. From leading waste reduction programs on the Sunshine Coast, to championing natural asset management in Gibsons, to advocating for public transit and EV infrastructure, Jeremy's career has been rooted in sustainability. And now, as the first BC Green member elected on the mainland, he's helping shape a new chapter for the party. So in this session, we'll hear from Jeremy  on his reflections on the direction that the BC Greens are headed in, the party's clean energy priorities, and we'll also dive into how those policies intersect with the realities many of us are navigating on the ground, from permitting to procurement to Indigenous partnerships and economic realities. So with that, please join me in welcoming Jeremy Ferriero.  Thanks, Ina. So I'm really happy to be here. And it's very familiar to me because as a young engineer and environmental consultant in the 2000s, I used to attend these conferences back when it was IPPBC. Some of you probably remember that. And I do see a few familiar faces. So it's great to be brought up to speed, and it's good to be on the cusp of a new age for this industry. I know that 15 years has been a long time, but there's a lot of excitement in this room.  So, and I, yeah, so I got to work on small hydro projects in the Cloughlin Valley, the upper bridge of Vancouver Island, and up north as working on environmental mitigation and engineering constraints. And now I'm an elected representative for the BC Greens. It's a bit of a strange journey through local government, but we've elected two Green MLAs. Neither of us returning, we're brand new, so we're in a steep learning curve.  but right after the election, very tight election, as you remember, we were thrown into a negotiation with the government to support them on budget and confidence motions, and we were able to agree on a series of projects that we're gonna work on together, shared priorities, health, housing, transit, forests, electoral reform. The one that's probably of most interest to you is a full review of the Clean BC Climate Plan, which is a year ahead of schedule, we agreed the science is moving quickly,  the needs for energy are changing quickly. So we've worked very closely with Minister Dix to establish in terms of reference and then select expert panellists. Marin Smith and Dan Vanilovic, probably don't need any introduction in this room, but they bring a lot of expertise to this table. And so with input from stakeholders and the public and the Climate Solutions Council, they are doing a full review that's supposed to be  finish by October, so I know people think of a review as a bit of a yawner and won't produce anything to you, but this is a pretty critical stage for our climate plan. As you know, we haven't been meeting our targets and we're unfortunately in a bit a lull in terms of public enthusiasm for climate action. I'm very confident that it's cyclable and we will resume our focus on climate when we get through some of these other challenges that we're facing.  But we're not meeting our targets and we need to figure out how to do that. So updating from the 2018 plan and the scope for these reviewers is everything's on the table. We're looking for transformative change. We are looking for a paradigm shift in how we tackle climate and this industry will be a huge part of that. I'm not going to prejudge their results but I know that electrification will be major push. So we're really excited for the previous  call to power and the one that's coming up. All of you are leading the way in this and government should be listening to you. I'm really encouraged to hear some of the earlier presentations. We're beating IEA projections for solar. First Nations financing seems to be making major strides. So what our Green Caucus thinks that we need is an overarching vision for power in this province instead of lurching from call to call 15 years apart and rebates  get brought in, rebates get canceled, we need a big picture energy pathways assessment. And so a lot has been done. There's been a big rush that tariff threat has caused this government to move quickly, and in some ways that can be good. I have lived the permitting gauntlet of 15 different ministries and 15 different permits. I'm glad to see a one window option.  as we all know, the BC Energy Regulatory hasn't been involved in this before, so we're very concerned to see what their process will look like and how they'll tackle this, and it's great to have Michelle speak to that earlier. So we're looking at proposed legislation from this government that has some pretty significant changes about how energy projects are assessed, including the major North Coast transmission line. So if it promotes streamlining and it creates a wind window,  That's great, but we also need to make sure that we don't rush to get this wrong. So we need to get us right. And I know we all, and I share the frustration that government moves can move quite slowly. But to take some of these bills, bill seven is the most notable one that you'll have heard of. Bills 14 and 15 are streamlining but concentrating a huge amount of power in the cabinet rather than putting it through the legislature and your dearly elected representatives. So to think that these bills  go from a draft 10 days ago to being law by the end of May, that is extremely quick and we believe that they need the proper screening. So that's our job, to make sure that we don't sacrifice the rigor of environmental assessment and the social license that we all know that we get from proper consultation. So I can't stress enough that BC Greens obviously support the development of renewable energy  supportive of ways to speed this up so we can get these things built. But we are very wary of moving too fast and seeing a social backlash, and we know that there is resistance to some communities. So you bring communities along, allow First Nations to participate, and those are key to success. We haven't heard that from some of the stakeholders so far, so we'll be examining the extent of this bill and these bills.  trying to figure out how to make them work. I'm not here to monologue. Actually, I think Ina has one question, but I'd actually like to hear some questions for you. But I also want to have statements in the form of questions, because really, you are the experts. You've been dealing with this regulatory regime and this industry for years. And I'd like to know how the province can harness the potential that's in this room.  energy should be non-partisan this is about how we this is the way forward we all know this is way forward and we have to we have some catching up to do but it should not be driven by partisanship so please think of a question or statement I'd like to hear your thoughts on the bringing in of a BC Energy regulator and some of the other industry conditions and constraints and I'll go ahead and take one question first.  Valeria was really eager to hear from the room. So I'll ask my one and then we'll open it up to the floor. So thank you so much, Jeremy. There's obviously a lot of thought going into the Green's approach. And I know that everyone in the room is eager to connect that vision to the work that we're doing in the clean energy sector. So especially when it comes to delivering projects on the ground. So my one question before we turn to before your election 2024, most recently,  last fall, rightly identified that the election platform document that your party put out rightly identified the need for long-term procurement targets and workforce development. As someone trying to plan and finance these projects, I say predictability is everything. So what would a stable, investor-friendly, clean energy plan look like from a BC Green perspective? One that delivers both on climate outcomes and economic circumstances.  I know you've touched on it a little bit, but let us know. What's your plan? Yeah, I mean, I think we all know that predictability is key, and like I've said, lurching between culture power every 15 years doesn't work. I think the key piece for us is, like I said, the government needs to articulate a vision and how we're going to get there. Like any enterprise, there needs to be targets that we actually  make the climate targets are excessively frustrating because there's really no consequences to not meeting them, and that's really not the way we should be. They need to be linked to some kind of consequences. We're extremely keen on supporting technological innovation, so the fact that geothermal and battery storage is included in this call is really, really important, and all the other innovation that's taking place. We just heard a whole lot about solar  energy community, energy co-ops. We do have a paradigm shift to make in this province. It's not all resource extraction. We can be a clean Canada, can be an energy superpower. We need to look at domestic use. And then the certainty that comes with funding and training and job creation, we will hear about skilled trades. So we need to set the foundation for this now. We needed to be setting it five to 10 years ago.  And that's where we need to say, we know where we're going. BC Hydro may be building a big hydropower dam, but we know we're gonna need more energy. And so this, you know, we saw the curves versus the IEA projections on solar, and I think we need be bullish about planning this for the future and be bold. Any questions from the floor, or should I go to the rest of the questions? Well, it's a good thing I cracked five.  Thanks for sticking with us to the end of the day. You touched on it a little bit, but let's expand on it further. Given today's geopolitical and economic uncertainties, energy security is coming more and more. How do the Greens view energy sovereignty and what role should renewable energy play in strengthening BC's self-sufficiency?  important in the discussions about an east-west energy grid. And this crisis does create an opportunity for us to find those, and part of Bill 7 is about decreasing inter-provincial trade barriers. I guess I just want to draw the distinction between energy sovereignty at home and the supply of energy that we need here versus massive exports of gas, of liquefied  So to the Greens, that's a climate disaster, and it's not necessarily part of our energy sovereignty. We'd like to live within our borders, use the resources that we have here to strengthen that sovereignty and move forward with that. It's not necessary about export. And I think the transition is key to where we land in this.  back away from renewables, then maybe that's an opportunity for us. I know you're not all seeing that on the ground yet, but that's what we would hope to create those conditions that allow that to happen. Okay, thank you. I see through the app that we've got one question that's come in. So the question is, what specifically do the BC Greens want to change with Bill 14? Is there a balance between regulatory efficiency and environmental protections? Yeah, thanks. That's a great question. It's trying to achieve that.  that balance. And Bill 14 is, I'll say, less challenging for us than Bill 15, because Bill 15 is just a blanket cabinet that determines what's a significant project, and it goes ahead, it can be a very streamlined environmental assessment process that is essentially what cabinet decides. Bill 14, it's about renewable energy, so we are trying to be supportive, we're trying to work our ways through it, but the changes that we want  really about transparency and oversight. If BC Energy Regulator is going to regulate these, that's great. They're currently not as transparent as, say, the Environmental Assessment Office, but also the cabinet decisions that are going to set that process need to be transparent and they need to accountable. With Bill 7, we agreed that we would have a legislative committee of all parties so they could nonpartisan have a look at the regulations after they're established. And at least that  the opportunity to point out what's not working, find the unintended consequences, and maybe change course. If it's all done behind closed doors in the cabinet, then that's not going to work. That's going to build more mistrust in government, and it's gonna create more of a backlash, which I don't want any of you to see, because I think these projects are really important. So the balance is more about transparency and oversight of making sure that these processes don't get short-circuited.  and to the detriment of really all of us. Okay, thank you. I think we've got time for just one last quick follow-up question. It's actually a question that I put together and I feel like it goes hand-in-hand with the one that was just asked. Specifically around...I feel like your party has been a little bit critical. I watched the question period and I've seen some of the remarks or heard some the remarks with regard to the most recent procurement, pricing, and so on and so forth, and obviously permitting  reform, as someone working directly in the industry and sector, I'm curious, who are you consulting with to form these positions? Are you talking to developers, indigenous nations as partners, local communities as part of that dialogue, or does it mostly happen within the policy and advocacy sphere and circles? Yeah, great question. Victoria can be a bit of a bubble and that's, you know, I've spent a lot of time there in the last few months and I'm looking forward to getting back  back to get grounded in the CS guide and the rest of the province. So there is some policy pieces that has a bit disconnected in Victoria. I've heard from some developers, I'm here to put my name out there and hear from more. I would say we take most of our guidance at this time from First Nations. So for example, the Union of BC and Anne Chieves has come out strongly on Bill 15 and we believe that they really have a strong argument.  to make about free fire and informed consent and participation, same with First Nations Leadership Council, and then when it comes to some of these, that local governments are also throwing up caution. Not so much about the renewable energy, Bill 14, but about Bill 15 and infrastructure projects in general, kind of steamrolling local governments has been done in the past, and I would argue it's not good for the overall process.  I don't think it's good for public trust in institutions. So the people that we're listening to are to some degree your kind of typical green advisors, but we are my job. I got into this because I thought we needed more people with a technical background, more engineers and scientists and politics. And so I'll listen to anybody and if there's proponents that have  I have really strong opinions about how this should be done. I would love to hear from you. I've got some cards and you can find me online. But it is really important to hear people doing it on the ground. There are people who are sitting in offices, as we all know, who haven't done this work and they need to hear it from you and sometimes that can be really difficult to get that message through. So I'm open to hearing more and I think that's good.  That's what government needs to do too and sometimes we get on this ideological track and we get television on what we should do and we're just trying to make sure that doesn't happen. Thank you very much. So I'm afraid that that's all the time that we have. Jeremy, thank you so much for being here today.
